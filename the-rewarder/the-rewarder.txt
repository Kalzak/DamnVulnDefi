A pool offering rewards every 5 days for people who have deposited DTV tokens
Alice, Bob, Charlie, David have deposited DVT tokens and got rewards
You have no DVT token
In upcoming reward round, you have to claim most rewards for yourself
New pool on mainnet doing DVT flashloans

Files:
	RewardToken.sol 		(The ERC20 token that is given when as a reward for depositing DVT tokens)
	AccountingTokens.sol		(ERC20-like token to track deposits & withdrawals, used by TheRewarderPool)
	FlashLoanerPool.sol		(Simple pool to get flash loans of DVT)
	TheRewarderPool.sol		(The pool that gives rewards to depositors)

The security flaw is with the function `distributeRewards` in `TheRewarderPool.sol`
The amount held by the users who have deposited is done by the snapshot which isn't an accurate representation of holdings currently
We can use a flashloan to say that we have a lot of tokens deposited in the contract before a snapshot runs
Then we can claim the rewards with our large amount of funds from the flashloan 
Once we have claimed rewards we withdraw and return funds to the flashLoanPool
