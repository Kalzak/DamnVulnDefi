Flash loans in the form of DVT tokens are being offered for free
Pool has 1MM DVT tokens in balance
You start with nothing
Try to get all tokens from the pool in a single TX

The token makes an external call to any contract that we can choose in the `flashLoan` function
We can't use this for reentrancy because there is the OpenZeppelin reentrancy prevention library in use
We CAN make a call to approve for token transfers if we pass the ERC20 token as the `target` address
In order to have a successful transfer, we can't touch the balance of the contract
Fortunately there aren't any zero checks for amount borrowed
We can simply request a flashloan of value zero
The contract for this attack is able to steal the funds in one TX
