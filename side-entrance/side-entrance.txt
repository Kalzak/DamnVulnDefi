Lending pool allows anyone to deposit ETH, and withdraw anytime
Has 1000ETH in balance already
Offering free flash loans using the deposited ETH
Take all ETH from lending pool

Before a flashloan is given, the current balance of the lending pool is checked
Then the flashloan is executed on `msg.sender`s `execute()` function
Then a check is done to see if the balance is the contract hasn't reduced in any way (any loss of funds)
Inside the our flashloan function we can make a deposit with the flashloan funds
This way we 'own' the funds according to the contract but at the same time the funds are going back to the lending pool
This means that the conditions in the require statement will still be met
