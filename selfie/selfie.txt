Need to be able to call the `drainAllFunds` function
To do that, we need to be able to propose an action throught the governance contract
In order to propose an action we need to have over half the supply of tokens
We can get these tokens by calling a flashloan to the contracts address
Now that we have met the requirements for governance we are able to propose to drain all funds
